# What you should know



A unique feature for Telerik RadGrid is the support for hierarchical representation of related data tables (DataSet).

## Master Table

The **MasterTableView** is the topmost table of the hierarchical structure. It is a **GridTableView Class** with **GridTableViewCollection Class**. The collection holds the so called DetailTables - tables related to the fields of the MasterTable. Each DetailTable can have its own **GridTableViewCollection** with other Detail Tables, thus forming the hierarchical structure.

You can look on the MasterTable as a Root for the hierarchical tree. All tables underneath will be the tree nodes. The MasterTable is an object and has own sections of properties in Visual Studio.

## Detail Tables

Detail tables are the inner tables of the grid. They are related to a field in its parent table.

Each Detail Table is placed in an item (row) of its parent table. This special item is called **NestedViewItem**.

## Expand/Collapse all

RadGridâ€™s hierarchy structure has been extended with buttons in the hierarchy expand column headers that allow all detail items ona given level to be expanded/collapsed. The buttons in question are switched on through the**EnableHierarchyExpandAll** property exposed both on the level of the grid and the table views.

The new expand-all functionality supports all hierarchy load modes.

When you have grouping and hierarchy combined in a common table view, the visibility of the hierarchy expand-all button depends on whether the expand-all button for the last group level is expanded/visible.

## Controlling Expanded State

By default, the items in a hierarchical RadGrid are collapsed. In order to expand them automatically, you can use the **HierarchyDefaultExpanded** property. If the hierarchy structure contains several levels, the property should be set for every  GridTableView instance separately.
````ASP.NET
<MasterTableView HierarchyDefaultExpanded="true">
````

 Since Q3 2013 version, RadGrid also provides the convenient  **RetainExpandStateOnRebind** property. When you enable it, the expanded state of the parent items will be preserved automatically on rebinding actions like Paging, Editing, etc.
